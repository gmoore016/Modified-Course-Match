# Modified-Course-Match
A modification of Eric Budish's 2011 Course Match mechanism designed to allow market administrators influence the allocation of courses, constructed for a Market Design class at Stanford University in the fall of 2019. 

My writeup of the concept is available [here](https://github.com/gmoore016/Modified-Course-Match/blob/master/Modified-Course-Match.pdf).
